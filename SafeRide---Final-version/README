SafeRide App by the Riders (Zhibin Zhang, Conor Tracey, Jacob Brown)
for CIS 422 Spring 2016
Project 1

Our Project can be visited at http://ix.cs.uoregon.edu:5601.

This project uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Python/Flask, Google Maps, and SQLite to allow users to submit a request online to a
simple database which can then be accessed by dispatchers. Dispatchers are able to copy a code from these requests into a Google
spreadsheet and erase the entry from the database. If the user's addresses are valid, a page will display them both on a map.

Files/folders of note:
   "database_init.py" initializes a simple database called "requests"
   "master_init.py" initializes a simple database which users with bad standing are put into
   "dispatch_display.py" is the file that is responsible to accepting user input, accessing databases, and directing users 
      throughout the site.
   "input_val.py" checks whether the addresses entered are valid and if the student ID is in the correct format
   "map_util.py" is used to integrate Google Maps with flask
   "templates" contains each of the web-pages to be displayed by dispatch_display.py.
   "Makefile" - use command "make install" to create the virtual environment and command "make run" to launch the application
